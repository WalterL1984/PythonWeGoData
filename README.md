# 🚍 WeGo Transit Data Analysis

A Python data analysis project examining public transit reliability using WeGo Transit headway and on-time adherence data (August–September 2023).

---

## 📌 Project Summary

This project analyzes headway and on-time performance for the **WeGo Public Transit system** over a two-month period to identify patterns in bus reliability. By measuring on-time performance by hour of day and weekday, this analysis highlights service reliability trends and visualizes where improvements may be needed.

The goal is to provide **actionable insights** for transit planners, operations teams, or city officials seeking to improve schedule adherence and rider experience.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Evaluate on-time performance of WeGo transit vehicles.
- Identify patterns in headway adherence by:
  - hour of day
  - day of week
- Visualize reliability trends to support data-driven transit decisions.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis
- GitHub for version control and project documentation

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Components

### 1. Headway Distribution  
Analyzes the spacing (headway) between transit vehicles to see how closely buses match scheduled intervals.

### 2. On-Time Performance by Hour  
Visualizes early/late arrivals by hour of the day to identify peak reliability issues.

### 3. Weekday Reliability Comparison  
Compares adherence patterns across weekdays to spot systemic performance trends.

## 📈 Insights & Key Findings

- **Certain times of day show recurring adherence issues**, especially during peak periods.
- **Weekday patterns suggest variability** in reliability that decision-makers could investigate further.
- Visualizations highlight where additional service or operational adjustments could yield better on-time performance.

## 🔍 How to Run This Project

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Python and required packages (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.) if you don’t already have them.
3. Open `We Go Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run each cell in order to reproduce the data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

---

## 🧠 Potential Next Steps

- Integrate additional months of data (seasonality exploration).
- Compare headway variance by route or stop location.
- Build predictive models for on-time arrival probabilities.
- Create interactive visual dashboards using Power BI or Plotly.
